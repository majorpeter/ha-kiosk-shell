# Home Automation Kiosk Shell

## What this is

This is a configurable Python application that can download a file from TFTP, search for patterns in it and launch other applications when a pattern is found. It can be installed as a replacement shell for a user on Windows.

## The use case

My PC is used for development on Linux and gaming on Windows. It is also part of my home automation setup and can be started with either OS remotely. Note that it's also far away from the TV.

This tool allows me to boot into a game library ([Playnite](https://playnite.link/)) with controller support without a keyboard and a mouse (with autologon). It can also log out of the autologon session if Windows not started for gaming only.
